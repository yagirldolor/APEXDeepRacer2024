Bugs:
+ Display ROUTE log info, then go to different analysis and change the episode selector << or >> (log info should close), and return to ROUTE circle highlight is still there!!
+ pressing a button when screen is already drawing does not redraw but does still press the button - VERY ODD BUG FOR THE USER


Tech debt:
+ Migrate all heatmap/routes to the new approach used for steering straight/left/right
+ professionalise and standardize remaining (graph) colours to match excellent quality of new heatmaps / Standardize graph colours as constants (esp. the C1, C2 etc.)
+ Implement coding standards
+ Add unit tests!!!

Customizability:
+ Heatmap start exclusion - move its config into the personalize area
+ Move sector definitions into new personalization area (same approach as for track annotations)
+ Finish simple re-org of config in the "personalize" package instead ...

Minor Enhancements:
+ Lap time estimate should account for start-up time in first 1 or 2 seconds ...
+ Show training start point more clearly as different shape (e.g. diamond)




Brand New Analysis Views
======================
Newest idea - ability to show relationship between reward and characteristics like speed and pos from centre - 1D and 2D (coloured)
Detailed drilldown into "outcomes" at a particular waypoint - esp. graphs to show outcome of different positions (e.g. success % beyond point)
Track-only view - with facilities like measuring distance between points, inside versus outside distance, ability to draw and measure a path etc.
Best possible lap time predictor - by piecing together fastest sections

Existing Analysis Enhancements
=============================
(lap) time correlation with certain actions (e.g. percent of actions that are in the filter, see also +++)
Offer reward correlations without final reward included in total?...
Exit points: + show last second or similar as a line (alternative to dots)
Training/Learning stats - offer additional optional plotting of estimated lap time
Episode slide is not finished - should have same/similar filters as for episode speed, reward & so on
Ability to flag favourite episodes (****)   OR ALLOW USER TO "TAG" EPISODES (and then quote a TAG as a filter criteria)
Quarterly progress - make sure Q really are now as even as possible + decide if/how to eliminate a final iteration if not complete
Ability to stipulate that sector times (esp. for correlation) must have a survival period before and/or after ... (i.e. skip slow starts, and risky finishes)
Colour-code quarterly progress to see at a glance if learning or not - and then can add a LOT of new indicators - like a true dashboard...
Enhance action space analysis to show distribution within each sector (multiple graphs on screen at same time ...)
Race might be able to move bots (would need to be for ONE episode only ... )?

Filters
=======
Find sequences +++
More quick-choice options for action filtering?? (esp. turning rather than speed)
Enhance "sector" with DIY "section" capability too ... with ability to set a section using mouse markers (drag and drop start and finish markers), as well entering waypoint numbers
Enhance episode section/sector filtering for additional characteristics of the section e.g. min/max reward etc.
Ability to filter episode for entire total score (with or without last step)

+++ Remembering to add these to all relevant analysis views as new choices etc.

Special Features
================
Ability to join several files together as a single set of episodes for analysis



Documentation
=============

YouTube videos
